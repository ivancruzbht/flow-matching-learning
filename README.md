# Flow Matching learning

Repository for implementations of code, notebooks, and other materials for learning the concepts behind flow matching for generative AI. Flow matching-based techniques are the de-facto techniques for the newest gen AI models (Stable Diffusion 3, Audiobox, etc)

* **conditional-flow-matching-toy** - Jupyter notebook (Original https://bm371613.github.io/conditional-flow-matching/) with comments and annotations on the inner works and logic.
